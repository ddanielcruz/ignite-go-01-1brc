# Ignite Go 01 - 1 Billion Row Challenge

This project is a simple implementation of the 1 Billion Row Challenge (1BRC) using Go. It's part of the [Rocketseat Golang course](rocketseat.com.br), designed to help developers learn and apply Go concepts through practical challenges.

## Project Overview

The 1BRC implementation processes a large dataset of weather measurements from a file named `measurements.txt`. It calculates and outputs the minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures for each weather station in the dataset.

This project serves as a hands-on exercise to explore Go's capabilities in handling large-scale data processing tasks while learning the language's core features.

## Running the Program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Go installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Place your `measurements.txt` file in the project directory.
4. Run `go run main.go` in the terminal.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance your understanding of Go!
